# NestJS Microservices with RabbitMQ & GraphQL

This guide explains how to set up and run a microservices architecture with NestJS applications using GraphQL and RabbitMQ for inter-service communication.

## Architecture Overview

Our system consists of two NestJS microservices:

- **Auth Service** (port 3002): Acts as a RabbitMQ client and exposes a GraphQL API
- **users Service** (port 3001): Acts as a RabbitMQ server and handles users data operations

The services communicate via RabbitMQ message broker, with the Auth Service sending requests and the users Service responding with users data.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 
- RabbitMQ server running ([Installation guide](#rabbitmq-windows-setup-guide))
- NPM or Yarn

## RabbitMQ Setup
  Exlained Below this tutorial

## Starting the Services: Open two terminals on the main repository and run these commands on each terminal 

### users Service (RabbitMQ Server) & Auth Service (RabbitMQ Client)

1. Navigate to the users service directory in one terminal and auth service directory in the other 
   ```bash
   cd users-service
   ```
      ```bash
   cd auth-service
   ```

2. Install dependencies on each terminal:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the service on each terminal:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

4. The users Service will start on port 3001 and establish itself as a RabbitMQ server
    The Auth Service will start on port 3002 and connect to RabbitMQ as a client

## How RabbitMQ Works in Our Setup

1. **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ acts as a message broker that facilitates communication between our services
   
2. **Producer/Consumer Model**:
   - Auth Service (producer) sends messages to RabbitMQ
   - users Service (consumer) listens for messages and processes them
   - users Service sends responses back through RabbitMQ
   - Auth Service receives and processes these responses

3. **Flow of a Request**:
   - Client sends a GraphQL query to Auth Service
   - Auth Service sends a message to RabbitMQ
   - users Service receives the message, processes it, and sends the result back
   - Auth Service returns the response to the client

## Testing the API

To test the microservices communication:

1. Ensure both services and RabbitMQ are running
2. Use a GraphQL client (like Apollo Studio, Insomnia, Postman) or cURL to send this query to the Auth Service:

   Endpoint: `http://localhost:3002/graphql`

   Query:
   ```graphql
   query Validate {
       validate(id: "123") {
           id
           name
       }
   }
   ```

3. You should receive the following response:
   ```json
   {
       "data": {
           "validate": {
               "id": "123",
               "name": "John Doe"
           }
       }
   }
   ```

## How It Works Behind the Scenes

When you send the GraphQL query to the Auth Service:

1. Auth Service receives the GraphQL query
2. It creates a message with the users ID and publishes it to a RabbitMQ exchange
3. The message is routed to a queue that the users Service is subscribed to
4. users Service consumes the message, retrieves the users data for ID "123"
5. users Service publishes a response message to a reply queue
6. Auth Service receives the response from the reply queue
7. Auth Service formats and returns the GraphQL response to the client

## Troubleshooting

- **Services won't start**: Ensure RabbitMQ is running with `rabbitmqctl status`
- **Connection refused errors**: Check if the RabbitMQ connection settings match in both services
- **No response from API**: Verify both services are running and check logs for errors
- **GraphQL errors**: Make sure the GraphQL schema is properly defined in both services

# RabbitMQ Windows Setup Guide

A minimal guide for installing RabbitMQ on Windows, setting up PATH, and configuring the management plugin.

## Install Erlang

1. Download Erlang from the [official website](https://www.erlang.org/downloads)
2. Run the installer with administrator privileges
3. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   erl -version
   ```

## Install RabbitMQ

1. Download RabbitMQ installer from the [official website](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html)
2. Run the installer as administrator
3. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   rabbitmqctl status
   ```
4. If the service isn't running:
   ```bash
   net start RabbitMQ
   ```

## PATH Configuration

RabbitMQ should automatically add its binary directory to your PATH:
- `C:\Program Files\RabbitMQ Server\rabbitmq_server-x.y.z\sbin`

If commands aren't recognized, add to PATH manually:
1. Press `Win + X` and select "System"
2. Click "Advanced system settings" â†’ "Environment Variables"
3. Find "Path" in System variables, click "Edit"
4. Click "New" and add the RabbitMQ sbin directory path
5. Click "OK" to save changes
6. Open a new Command Prompt to apply changes

## Enable Management Plugin

1. Run as administrator:
   ```bash
   rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
   ```
2. Restart the RabbitMQ service:
   ```bash
   net stop RabbitMQ
   net start RabbitMQ
   ```
3. Access the management interface at [http://localhost:15672/](http://localhost:15672/)
4. Default credentials:
   - usersname: `guest`
   - Password: `guest`
   - Note: These credentials only work when connecting from localhost

## Create Admin users (Optional)

```bash
rabbitmqctl add_users admin strong_password
rabbitmqctl set_users_tags admin administrator
rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / admin ".*" ".*" ".*"
```

## Common RabbitMQ Commands

```bash
# Check service status
rabbitmqctl status

# List queues
rabbitmqctl list_queues

# List userss
rabbitmqctl list_userss

# List exchanges
rabbitmqctl list_exchanges

# List connections
rabbitmqctl list_connections
```
